# Data_visualization

This project helps students to compare their performance to different subjects and other students. 
This also helps teachers to work on student's weak areas so they can perform better.
This project deals with the 2763 students in three different subjects in 15 examinations.


## What did I learn ?
Most of the students are performing well at the start of coaching session and bad in the later part.
This maybe due to the fact that they have not revised the new content and syllabus was relatively 
easier in the beginning. Performance of students goes upward when there is 180 marks exam compared to
the 360 marks exam. 

## What did I use for visualization ?
I have used Plotly package of python to make interactive plots to visualize performance of students.

## Feature selection
1. I have created new column "percentile" by using scored marks, total marks and total no. of candidate
   in a given exam.
2. Percentile and date along with exam id and average marks are important features for interactive plots.
3. Exam id and scored marks are used to compare performance of student with topper.

## Conclusion
These type of plots can help students and teachers to enhance the performance of the student by giving extra
attenstion towards weak areas and also plan the exam accordingly.
